# Project 1 for COMP30019
Actual readme is in the Project 1/assets/ folder

addendum to the readme that is not in the lms submission:
>The lighting map may need to be rebuilt when running on a new device for the 
first time. You MUST rebuild the lightmaps for satisfactory lighting.

Please use the git version of the project where possible. Both versions should be the same however.
